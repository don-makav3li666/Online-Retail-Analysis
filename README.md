A. Sales and Revenue Analysis

I. Total Sales and Revenue by Product

Finding: The top-selling product by quantity (80995) is the "PAPER CRAFT , LITTLE BIRDIE" (StockCode 23843), which accounts for a significant portion of total sales volume. In terms of revenue, "REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER" (StockCode 22423) is the highest revenue-generating product (£174,484.74) due to its high unit price and quantity sold.

Insight: Maintaining adequate stock for these products could help meet customer demand, maximize sales and revenue.

II. Total Revenue Per Invoice

Finding: There is a positive pattern where products with most quantities ordered generating the most revenue; The highest revenue which is (£168,469.6) was generated by InvoiceNo 581483.
